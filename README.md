# Functions to be implemented

To implement this project, you need to implement the following functions and configure them in the `serverless.yml` file:

* `Auth` - this function should implement a custom authorizer for API Gateway that should be added to all other functions.

* `Getreviews` - should return all reviews for a current user. A user id can be extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend
